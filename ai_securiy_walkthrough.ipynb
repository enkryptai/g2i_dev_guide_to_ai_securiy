    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üõ†Ô∏è What We Explored\n",
    "1. **Baseline Chatbot (No Defenses)**  \n",
    "   - Direct calls to the model ‚Üí vulnerable to jailbreaks, leaks, and misuse.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hardened System Prompt**  \n",
    "   - Stronger role instructions reduced obvious manipulation attempts.  \n",
    "   - Important, but not sufficient on its own.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Guardrails Detectors**  \n",
    "   - Pre-checks for injection attacks, NSFW, PII, toxicity, etc.  \n",
    "   - Catch risky inputs *before* they reach the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Policy-Based Guardrails**  \n",
    "   - Enforce business & compliance rules consistently.  \n",
    "   - Block/withhold unsafe *outputs* from the model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **End-to-End Secure Flow**  \n",
    "   - Input Guardrails ‚Üí Model (hardened) ‚Üí Output Guardrails  \n",
    "   - Simulates how **real secure apps** are built.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîë Key Takeaway\n",
    "**System prompts, Guardrails detectors, and Policy-based Guardrails work best together.**  \n",
    "This layered approach creates **defense-in-depth**, making your AI apps:  \n",
    "- Safer for users  \n",
    "- Aligned with business policies  \n",
    "- Resilient against evolving threats  \n",
